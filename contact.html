		<p>This section should guide you through the initial steps of contributing to OTR. Thank you! Welcome, we're delighted to see you! :)</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, comments, doubts or concerns, please, feel free to reach us at the #otr channel on the OFTC IRC network. We are working on also providing an slack channel for more contact. You can also contact us through our mailing list.</p>
		<p>For requests, suggestions and bug reports, please open an issue on our Gitlab, on the appropriate repository. If you want to fix a bug or suggest something, ask for mentoring to Sof√≠a Celi at sofia@otr.im</p>
		<p><strong>A few things anyone can do</strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Spread the word around OTR and its new version. Tell your friends!</li>
      <li>We always look for examples of how OTR is used or how or how can it be used. If you know, let us know!</li>
